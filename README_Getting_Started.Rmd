## Getting Started

The function `visstat()` accepts input in two ways:

```r
# Standardised form (recommended):
visstat(x, y)

# Backward-compatible form:
visstat(dataframe, "name_of_x", "name_of_y")
```

In the standardised form, `x` and `y` must be vectors of class `"numeric"`,
`"integer"`, or `"factor"`.

In the backward-compatible form, `"name_of_x"` and `"name_of_y"` must be
character strings naming columns in `dataframe`, which must themselves be of
class `"numeric"`, `"integer"`, or `"factor"`. This is equivalent to writing:

```r
visstat(dataframe[["name_of_x"]], dataframe[["name_of_y"]])
```

The interpretation of `x` and `y` depends on their classes:

- If one is numeric and the other is a factor, the numeric must be passed as `y`
  and the factor as `x`. This supports tests for group differences (e.g., t-test,
  ANOVA, Wilcoxon).

- If both are numeric, a linear model is fitted with `y` as the response and
  `x` as the predictor.

- If both are factors, a test of association is performed (Chi-squared or
  Fisherâ€™s exact). The test is symmetric, but the plot layout depends on which
  variable is supplied as `x`.

The wrapper standardises the input and forwards it to `visstat_core()`, which
selects the appropriate test and generates visual and numerical output.
