title = {{The two-sample t test: pre-testing its assumptions does not pay off}},

abstract = {Traditionally, when applying the two-sample t test, some pre-testing occurs. That is, the theory-based assumptions of normal distributions as well as of homogeneity of the variances are often tested in applied sciences in advance of the tried-for t test. But this paper shows that such pre-testing leads to unknown final type-I- and type-II-risks if the respective statistical tests are performed using the same set of observations. In order to get an impression of the extension of the resulting misinterpreted risks, some theoretical deductions are given and, in particular, a systematic simulation study is done. As a result, we propose that it is preferable to apply no pre-tests for the t test and no t test at all, but instead to use the Welch-test as a standard test: its power comes close to that of the t test when the variances are homogeneous, and for unequal variances and skewness values |$\gamma$1| < 3, it keeps the so called 20% robustness whereas the t test as well as Wilcoxon{\textquoteright}s U test cannot be recommended for most cases.},

abstract = {It is widely but incorrectly believed that the t-test and linear regression are valid only for Normally distributed outcomes. The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},

abstract = {When we are trying to make the best estimate of some quantity A that is available from the research conducted to date, the problem of combining results from different experiments is encountered. The problem is often troublesome, particularly if the individual estimates were made by different workers using different procedures. This paper discusses one of the simpler aspects of the problem, in which there is sufficient uniformity of experimental methods so that the ith experi-ment provides an estimate xi of u, and an estimate si of the~{\ldots}
