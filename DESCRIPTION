Description: Visualization of the most powerful statistical hypothesis.
    The function vistat() visualizes the statistical hypothesis testing between the dependent variable (response) varsample and the independent variable (feature) varfactor. 
    The statistical hypothesis test (including the eventual corresponding post-hoc analysis) with the highest statistical power fulfilling
    the assumptions of the corresponding test is performed based on a decition tree
    A graph displaying the raw data accordingly to the chosen test as well as the test statistics is generated and returned.
    Implemented tests: lm(), t.test(), wilcox.test(), aov(), kruskal.test(), fisher.test(),chisqu.test().
    Implemented tests for check of normal distribution of standardized residuals: shapiro.test() and ks.test().
    For the comparison of averages, the following algorithm is implemented: 
    If the p-values of the standardized residuals of both shapiro.test() or ks.test() are smaller  than 1-conf.level, kruskal.test() resp. wilcox.test() are performed.
    otherwise the oneway.test() and aov() resp. t.test() are performed and displayed.
    For the test of independence of count data,  the following algorithm is implemented: 
    If more than 20 percent of cells have count smaller 5 (Cochran's rule), fisher.test() is performed and displayed, otherwise chisqu.test(). 
    In both cases case an additional mosaic plot showing Pearson's residuals is generated.
