Description: Visualization of the most powerful statistical hypothesis test.
    The R package `visStatistics` with its core function 
    visstat() provides means to quickly visualise and analyse raw data.
    Based on a decision tree it picks the statistical hypothesis test with 
    the highest statistical power between the dependent variable (response) and the independent variable
    (feature):
    For the comparison of averages, the chosen test depends on the p-values of the null that the normalized
    standardized residuals of the regression model are normally distributed as tested by both shapiro.test() or ad.test(). 
    If both p-values are smaller than the error probability 1-conf.level,the non-parametric tests kruskal.test() resp. wilcox.test()
    are performed, otherwise the parametric tests oneway.test() and aov() resp. t.test(). Exception: 
    If the sample size is bigger than 100, t.test() is always performed and wilcox.test() is never executed 
    (Lumley et al. (2002) <doi:10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140546>). 
    For the test of independence of count data, Cochran's rule (Cochran (1954) <doi:10.2307/3001666>) is implemented: 
    If more than 20 percent of all cells have a count smaller than 5, fisher.test() is performed and displayed,
    otherwise chisqu.test(). In both cases case an additional mosaic plot is generated. 
    Implemented tests: lm(), t.test(), wilcox.test(), aov(), kruskal.test(), fisher.test(), chisqu.test().
    Implemented tests to check the normal distribution of standardized residuals: shapiro.test() and ad.test().
    Implemented post-hoc tests: TukeyHSD() for aov() and pairwise.wilcox.test() for kruskal.test().
    All implemented  statistical tests are called with their default parameter sets which the exception of `conf.level`, which can be adjusted in the function call of `visstat()`.
    The `vissStatistics` vignette offers a detailed description of the decision tree and examples.
