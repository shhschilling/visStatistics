Description: Visualization of the most powerful statistical hypothesis test.
    Statistical consulting requires often both a quick first visualization and a reproducible
    statistical analysis of the presented raw data. The R package visStatistics with its core function 
    visstat() fulfils this need. Based on a decision tree it picks the statistical hypothesis test with 
    the highest statistical power between the dependent variable (response) and the independent variable
    (feature) varfactor. 
    Implemented tests: lm(), t.test(), wilcox.test(), aov(), kruskal.test(), fisher.test(), chisqu.test().
    Implemented tests to check the normal distribution of standardized residuals: shapiro.test() and ad.test().
    Implemented post-hoc tests: TukeyHSD() for aov() and pairwise.wilcox.test() for kruskal.test().
    For the comparison of averages, the implemented algorithm  depends on the value of the parameter of conf.level, which defaults to 0.95: 
    If the p-values of the standardized residuals of both shapiro.test() or ad.test() are smaller 
    than the error probability 1-conf.level, kruskal.test() resp. wilcox.test() are performed, otherwise the oneway.test()
    and aov() resp. t.test() are performed and displayed. Exception: 
    If the sample size is bigger than 100, t.test() is always performed and wilcox.test() is never executed 
    (Lumley et al. (2002) <doi:10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140546>). 
    For the test of independence of count data, Cochran's rule (Cochran (1954) <doi:10.2307/3001666>) is implemented: 
    If more than 20 percent of all cells have a count smaller than 5, fisher.test() is performed and displayed,
    otherwise chisqu.test(). In both cases case an additional mosaic plot is generated.
