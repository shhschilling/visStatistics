Description: Automated visualization of statistical hypothesis testing.
    The 'visStatistics' package provides automated visualization and selection
    of a statistical hypothesis test between a response and a feature variable
    in a data frame, chosen to be valid under the data's type, distribution,
    sample size, and user-defined 'conf.level'.
    Throughout, variables of class 'numeric' or 'integer' are referred to
    as numerical, variables of class 'factor' are referred to as
    categorical, and assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity are
    considered met when the corresponding test yields a p-value greater
    than alpha = 1 - 'conf.level'. When the response is numerical and the
    predictor is categorical with two levels, Welch's t-test (t.test())
    is used if both groups have more than 30 observations, relying on the
    central limit theorem (Lumley et al. (2002)
    <doi:10.1146/annurev.publheath.23.100901.140546>). For smaller
    samples, normality is assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test
    (shapiro.test()); if normality is met, Welch's t-test is applied;
    otherwise, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (wilcox.test()) is used. For
    predictors with more than two levels, an ANOVA model (aov()) is
    fitted if residuals are normally distributed (tested via
    shapiro.test() and ad.test()) and variances are homogeneous
    (bartlett.test()). If normality holds but variances differ,
    oneway.test() is used instead. If residuals are not normally
    distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis test (kruskal.test()) is selected,
    followed by pairwise Wilcoxon tests (pairwise.wilcox.test()). When
    both variables are numerical, a simple linear regression model
    (lm()) is fitted, with residual diagnostics and confidence band
    plots. When both variables are categorical, the null hypothesis of
    independence is tested using chisq.test() or fisher.test(), based on
    Cochran's rule (Cochran (1954) <doi:10.2307/3001666>). Post hoc
    tests include TukeyHSD() for ANOVA and oneway.test(), and
    pairwise.wilcox.test() for Kruskal-Wallis. The function outputs
    plots and returns an invisible list of test results. This automated workflow 
    is particularly suited for integration into browser-based interfaces or
    server-side R applications that interact with databases. A detailed
    vignette expands on the decision logic and accompanies each case
    with a reproducible example.
    Main tests: t.test(), wilcox.test(), aov(), oneway.test(), kruskal.test(),lm(),
    fisher.test(), chisq.test().
    Tests for normality: shapiro.test() and ad.test().
    Tests for homoscedasticity:bartlett.test()
    Post-hoc tests: TukeyHSD() for aov() and pairwise.wilcox.test() for kruskal.test().
