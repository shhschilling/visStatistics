Description: Automatically selects and visualises appropriate statistical 
    hypothesis tests between a response and a feature variable in a data frame. 
    The choice of test depends on the class, distribution, and sample size of the
    input variables, as well as the user-defined 'conf.level'. The package focuses
    on visualising the selected test using appropriate plots— such as box plots,
    bar charts, regression lines with confidence bands, mosaic plots, residual
    plots and Q–Q plots. Each plot is annotated with relevant test statistics
    and, where applicable, assumption checks and post-hoc results. The scripted 
    workflow is particularly well suited for interactive interfaces where users
    access data only through a graphical front end backed by server-side R 
    sessions, as well as for quick data exploration, for example, in statistical
    consulting contexts.
    Implemented tests: t.test(), wilcox.test(), aov(),
    oneway.test(), kruskal.test(), lm(), fisher.test(), chisq.test().
    Tests for normality: shapiro.test(), ad.test(). Tests for equal
    variances: bartlett.test(). Post-hoc tests: TukeyHSD(),
    pairwise.wilcox.test().
