Description: Visualization of the most powerful statistical hypothesis test.
    The 'visStatistics' package provides automated visualization and selection
    of the statistical hypothesis test with the highest statistical power between 
    a response and a feature variable in a data frame, based on their class,
    distribution, and sample size. Variables of class 'numeric' or 'integer' are 
    referred to as numerical, and variables of class 'factor' are referred to as 
    categorical. When the response is numerical and the predictor is categorical 
    with two levels, Welch's t-test (t.test()) is used if both groups have more 
    than 30 observations, relying on the central limit theorem 
    (Lumley et al. (2002) <doi:10.1146/annurev.publheath.23.100901.140546>).
    For smaller samples, normality is assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test (shapiro.test());
    if both groups return p-values greater than alpha, Welch's t-test is applied;
    otherwise, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (wilcox.test()) is used. For predictors 
    with more than two levels, an ANOVA model (aov()) is fitted if residuals are
    normally distributed (tested via shapiro.test() and ad.test()) and variances 
    are homogeneous (tested via bartlett.test()). If residuals are normal but variances 
    differ significantly, oneway.test() is used instead. If residuals are not normally 
    distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis test (kruskal.test()) is selected, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon 
    tests (pairwise.wilcox.test()). When both variables are numerical, 
    a simple linear regression model (lm()) is fitted, with residual diagnostics 
    and confidence band plots. When both variables are categorical, the null hypothesis 
    of independence is tested using chisq.test() or fisher.test(), 
    based on Cochran's rule (Cochran (1954) <doi:10.2307/3001666>). 
    Post hoc tests include TukeyHSD() for ANOVA and oneway.test(), and pairwise.wilcox.test()
    for Kruskal-Wallis. The function outputs plots and returns an invisible list
    of test results. The  parameter 'conf.level' sets the confidence 
    level for all procedures, it defaults to 0.95 and can be adjusted by the user. 
    A detailed vignette expands on the decision logic and accompanies each case with a reproducible example.
    Implemented main tests: t.test(), wilcox.test(), aov(), oneway.test(), kruskal.test(),lm(), fisher.test(), chisqu.test().
    Implemented tests to check the assumption of normality: shapiro.test() and ad.test().
    Implemented testto check the assumption of heteroscedacity:bartlett.test()
    Implemented post-hoc tests: TukeyHSD() for aov() and pairwise.wilcox.test() for kruskal.test().
