Description: Visualization of the most powerful statistical hypothesis.
    The function vistat() visualizes the statistical hypothesis testing between the dependent variable (response) varsample and the independent variable (feature) varfactor. 
    The statistical hypothesis test (including the corresponding post-hoc analysis) with the highest statistical power fulfilling
    the assumptions of the corresponding test is performed. 
    A graph displaying the raw data accordingly to the chosen test as well as the test statistics is generated and returned.
    Implemented tests: lm(), t.test(), wilcox.test(), aov(), kruskal.test(), fisher.test(),chisqu.test().
