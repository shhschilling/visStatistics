Description: The right test - visualised. 'visStatistics' automatically selects
    and visualises statistical hypothesis tests between two vectors,
    based on their class, distribution, sample size, and a user-defined
    confidence level (conf.level). Visual outputs - including box plots, bar charts,
    regression lines with confidence bands, mosaic plots,
    residual plots, and Q-Q plots - are annotated with relevant test statistics,
    assumption checks, and post-hoc analyses where applicable. 
    The algorithmic workflow helps the user focus on the interpretation of test
    results rather than test selection. It is particularly suited for quick data
    analysis, e.g., in statistical consulting projects or educational settings. 
    The test selection algorithm proceeds as follows:   
    Input vectors of class numeric or integer are
    considered numerical; those of class factor are considered categorical.
    Assumptions of residual normality and homogeneity of variances are 
    considered met if the corresponding test yields a p-value greater than the 
    significance level alpha = 1 - conf.level. 
    (1) When the response vector is numerical and the
    predictor vector is categorical, a test of central tendencies is selected.
    If the categorical predictor has exactly two levels, 
    t.test() is applied when group sizes exceed 30
    (Lumley et al. (2002) <doi:10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140546>). 
    For smaller samples, normality of residuals is tested using shapiro.test(); 
    if met, t.test() is used; otherwise, wilcox.test(). 
    If the predictor is categorical with more than two levels, an
    aov() is initially fitted. Residual normality is evaluated using both
    shapiro.test() and ad.test(); residuals are considered approximately normal
    if at least one test yields a p-value above alpha. If this assumption is met, 
    bartlett.test() assesses variance homogeneity. 
    If variances are homogeneous, aov() is used; otherwise oneway.test(). 
    Both tests are followed by TukeyHSD().
    If residual normality cannot be assumed, kruskal.test() is followed by 
    pairwise.wilcox.test().
    (2) When both the response and predictor vectors are numerical, 
    a simple linear regression model is fitted using lm(). 
    (3) When both vectors are categorical, Cochran's rule 
    (Cochran (1954) <doi:10.2307/3001666>)
    is applied to test independence either by chisq.test() or fisher.test().
