# visStatistics: The right test, visualised

The R package `visStatistics` enables visualisation and automatic
statistical testing of two variables from a data frame.

## Minimal usage

```r
# Standardised form (recommended)
visstat(x, y)

# Backward-compatible form
visstat(dataframe, "name_of_x", "name_of_y")
```

Both variables must be of class `"numeric"`, `"integer"`, or `"factor"`.

The interpretation of `x` and `y` depends on their types:

- If one is numeric and the other a factor, the numeric must be passed
  as `y` and the factor as `x`.

- If both are numeric, a linear model is fitted with `y` as the response
  and `x` as the predictor.

- If both are factors, the variables are tested for association. The order
  of `x` and `y` does not affect the test result, but it does influence
  the plot layout.
