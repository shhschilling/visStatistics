The purpose of this paper is to make a variety of these techniques more easily available, so that they can be tried out more widely. Techniques of analysis, some graphical, some wholly numerical, and others mixed, are discussed in terms of the residuals that result from fitting row and column means to entries in a two-way array (or in several two-way arrays). Extensions to more complex situations, and some of the uses of the results of examination, are indicated.}

  abstract = {Tests for comparing the locations of two independent populations are associated with different null hypotheses, but results are often interpreted as evidence for or against equality of means or medians. We examine the appropriateness of this practice by investigating the performance of five frequently used tests: the two-sample T test, the Welch U test, the Yuen--Welch test, the Wilcoxon--Mann--Whitney test, and the Brunner--Munzel test. Under combined violations of normality and variance homogeneity, the true significance level and power of the tests depend on a complex interplay of several factors. In a wide ranging simulation study, we consider scenarios differing in skewness, skewness heterogeneity, variance heterogeneity, sample size, and sample size ratio. We find that small differences in distribution properties can alter test performance markedly, thus confounding the effort to present simple test recommendations. Instead, we provide detailed recommendations in Appendix A. The Welch U test is recommended most frequently, but cannot be considered an omnibus test for this problem.},

  abstract = {The normality assumption postulates that empirical data derives from a normal (Gaussian) population. It is a pillar of inferential statistics that enables the theorization of probability functions and the computation of p-values thereof. The breach of this assumption may not impose a formal mathematical constraint on the computation of inferential outputs (e.g., p-values) but may make them inoperable and possibly lead to unethical waste of laboratory animals. Various methods, including statistical tests and qualitative visual examination, can reveal incompatibility with normality and the choice of a procedure should not be trivialized. The following minireview will provide a brief overview of diagrammatical methods and statistical tests commonly employed to evaluate congruence with normality. Special attention will be given to the potential pitfalls associated with their application. Normality is an unachievable ideal that practically never accurately describes natural variables, and detrimental consequences of non-normality may be safeguarded by using large samples. Therefore, the very concept of preliminary normality testing is also, arguably provocatively, questioned.},

All topics are presented in a precise and clear style supported with solved examples, numbered formulae, graphic illustrations, and "Notes" to provide depth and statistical accuracy and precision. Applications used within the text and the hallmark problems, exercises, and projects are drawn from virtually all disciplines and fields providing motivation for students in virtually any college.

Using the central limit theorem, a variety of parametric tests have been developed under assumptions about the parameters that determine the population probability distribution. Compared to non-parametric tests, which do not require any assumptions about the population probability distribution, parametric tests produce more accurate and precise estimates with higher statistical powers. However, many medical researchers use parametric tests to present their data without knowledge of the contribution of the central limit theorem to the development of such tests. Thus, this review presents the basic concepts of the central limit theorem and its role in binomial distributions and the Student's t-test, and provides an example of the sampling distributions of small populations. A proof of the central limit theorem is also described with the mathematical concepts required for its near-complete understanding.},

The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},

However, in fields as varying as education, politics, and health care, assessment and the use of measurement and statistics have become integral parts of almost every activity undertaken. These activities require the organization of ideas, the generation of hypotheses, the collection of data, and the interpretation, illustration, and analysis of data. No matter where educated people look, this critical analysis is more important than ever in an age where information - and lots of it - is readily available. The Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics presents state-of-the-art information and ready-to-use facts from the fields of measurement and statistics in an unintimidating style. The ideas and tools contained in these pages are approachable and can be invaluable for understanding our very technical world and the increasing flow of information. Although there are references that cover statistics and assessment in depth, none provides as comprehensive a resource in as focused and accessible a manner as the two volumes of this encyclopedia. Through approximately 500 contributions, experts provide an overview and an explanation of the major topics in these two areas. Key Features Covers every major facet of these two different, but highly integrated disciplines - from mean, mode, and median to reliability, validity, significance, correlation, and much more - all without overwhelming the informed reader Offers cross-disciplinary coverage, with contributions from and applications to the fields of Psychology, Education, Sociology, Human Development, Political Science, Business and Management, Public Health, and others Provides cross-reference terms, a brief listing of further readings, and Web site URLs following most entries, as well as an extensive set of appendices and an annotated list of organizations relevant to measurement and statistics Appendices Features Appendix A is a guide to basic statistics for those readers who might like an instructional step-by-step presentation of basic concepts in statistics and measurement Appendix B is a table of critical values used in hypothesis testing and an important part of any reference in this area Appendix C represents a collection of some important and useful measurement and statistics Internet sites A primary goal of creating this set of volumes is to open up the broad discipline of measurement and statistics to a wider and more general audience than usual},

Violations of these assumptions can cause various issues, like statistical errors and biased estimates, whose impact can range from inconsequential to critical. Accordingly, it is important to check these assumptions, but this is often done in a flawed way. Here, I first present a prevalent but problematic approach to diagnostics---testing assumptions using null hypothesis significance tests (e.g., the Shapiro--Wilk test of normality). Then, I consolidate and illustrate the issues with this approach, primarily using simulations. These issues include statistical errors (i.e., false positives, especially with large samples, and false negatives, especially with small samples), false binarity, limited descriptiveness, misinterpretation (e.g., of p-value as an~effect size), and potential testing failure due to unmet test assumptions. Finally, I synthesize the implications of these issues for statistical diagnostics, and provide practical recommendations for improving such diagnostics. Key recommendations include maintaining awareness of the issues with assumption tests (while recognizing they can be useful), using appropriate combinations of diagnostic methods (including visualization and effect sizes) while recognizing their limitations, and distinguishing between testing and checking assumptions. Additional recommendations include judging assumption violations as a complex spectrum (rather than a simplistic binary), using programmatic tools that increase replicability and decrease researcher degrees of freedom, and sharing the material and rationale involved in the diagnostics.},

  abstract = {When clinical data are subjected to statistical analysis, a common question is how to choose an appropriate significance test. Comparing two independent groups with observations measured on a continuous scale, the question is typically whether to choose the two-sample-t test or the Wilcoxon--Mann--Whitney test (WMW test). Similar results are often obtained, but which conclusion can be drawn if significance tests give highly different P-values? The t test is optimal for normally distributed observations with common variance and robust to deviations from normality if sample sizes are not very small. The WMW test makes no distributional assumptions, but depends heavily on equal shape and variance of the two distributions (homoscedasticity). We have compared the properties of the traditional two-sample t test, a modified t test allowing unequal variance, and the WMW test by stochastic simulation. All show acceptable behaviour when the two distributions have similar variance. When variances differ, the modified t test is superior to the other two.},

  abstract = {In calculus, plaque, and gingivitis trials, measures are taken on subjects both prior to the use of an active treatment and after its use. When the trial is short-term, or when a cleaning of the mouth takes place after the baseline measurement, distributions of such measures (e.g., the Volpe-Manhold score or the Loe and Silness scale) are approximately normally distributed above zero but also can have a proportion of subjects who attain scores of zero. When the effects of an active treatment are compared with those of a control, the two-independent-sample t test can be applied to outcome scores or to differences between the baseline and outcome scores. Robustness of these t tests, in the presence of distributions "distorted" from normality as described, was investigated by computer simulation. In general, both t tests produced actual significance levels which were close to nominal significance levels, even in the presence of small samples and distributions in which as many as 50\% of the subjects attained scores of zero.},

This study compares normality testing methods which have been verified excellent based on power, considering significance levels, sample sizes, and alternative distributions in addition to their powers. Furthermore we evaluate the performance of the testing methods using the expected and median values of p-values of the corresponding test statistics.},

  abstract = {In most clinical trials, the main interest is to test whether there are differences in the mean outcomes among the treatment groups. When the outcome is continuous, a common statistical test is a usual t-test for a two-group comparison. For more than 2 groups, an ANOVA setup is used and the test for equality for all groups is based on the F-distribution. A key assumption for these parametric tests is that data are normally, independently distributed and the response variances are equal. The robustness of these tests to the first two assumptions is quite well investigated, but the issues arising from heteroscedasticity are less studied. This paper reviews different methods for ascertaining homogeneity of variance across groups and investigates the consequences of heteroscedasticity on the tests. Simulations based on normal, heavy-tailed, and skewed normal data demonstrate that some of the less known methods, such as the Jackknife or Cochran's test, are quite effective in detecting differences in the variances.},

However, these techniques involve a variety of methods, mathematical formulas, and underlying concepts, which can be complex. Could the non-parametric bootstrap, known for its simplicity and general applicability, serve as a universal alternative? In this study, we address this question through a review of existing literature and a simulation analysis of one- and two-sided confidence intervals across varying sample sizes, confidence levels, data-generating processes, and statistical functionals. Our findings indicate that the double bootstrap consistently performs best and is a promising alternative to traditional methods used for common statistical tasks. These results suggest that the bootstrap, particularly the double bootstrap, could simplify statistical education and practice without compromising effectiveness.},
