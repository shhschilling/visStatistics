These give information on various questions of interest, and in particular, aid in assessing the validity or appropriateness of the conventional analysis. The purpose of this paper is to make a variety of these techniques more easily available, so that they can be tried out more widely. Techniques of analysis, some graphical, some wholly numerical, and others mixed, are discussed in terms of the residuals that result from fitting row and column means to entries in a two-way array (or in several two-way arrays). Extensions to more complex situations, and some of the uses of the results of examination, are indicated.}

The final part of the paper presents 8 tutorials of robust statistical methods using R that cover a range of variants of the GLM (t-tests, ANOVA, multiple regression, multilevel models, latent growth models).

The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},

  abstract = {"The study of measurement and statistics can be less than inviting. However, in fields as varying as education, politics, and health care, assessment and the use of measurement and statistics have become integral parts of almost every activity undertaken. These activities require the organization of ideas, the generation of hypotheses, the collection of data, and the interpretation, illustration, and analysis of data. No matter where educated people look, this critical analysis is more important than ever in an age where information - and lots of it - is readily available. The Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics presents state-of-the-art information and ready-to-use facts from the fields of measurement and statistics in an unintimidating style. The ideas and tools contained in these pages are approachable and can be invaluable for understanding our very technical world and the increasing flow of information. Although there are references that cover statistics and assessment in depth, none provides as comprehensive a resource in as focused and accessible a manner as the two volumes of this encyclopedia. Through approximately 500 contributions, experts provide an overview and an explanation of the major topics in these two areas. Key Features Covers every major facet of these two different, but highly integrated disciplines - from mean, mode, and median to reliability, validity, significance, correlation, and much more - all without overwhelming the informed reader Offers cross-disciplinary coverage, with contributions from and applications to the fields of Psychology, Education, Sociology, Human Development, Political Science, Business and Management, Public Health, and others Provides cross-reference terms, a brief listing of further readings, and Web site URLs following most entries, as well as an extensive set of appendices and an annotated list of organizations relevant to measurement and statistics Appendices Features Appendix A is a guide to basic statistics for those readers who might like an instructional step-by-step presentation of basic concepts in statistics and measurement Appendix B is a table of critical values used in hypothesis testing and an important part of any reference in this area Appendix C represents a collection of some important and useful measurement and statistics Internet sites A primary goal of creating this set of volumes is to open up the broad discipline of measurement and statistics to a wider and more general audience than usual},

  abstract = {In calculus, plaque, and gingivitis trials, measures are taken on subjects both prior to the use of an active treatment and after its use. When the trial is short-term, or when a cleaning of the mouth takes place after the baseline measurement, distributions of such measures (e.g., the Volpe-Manhold score or the Loe and Silness scale) are approximately normally distributed above zero but also can have a proportion of subjects who attain scores of zero. When the effects of an active treatment are compared with those of a control, the two-independent-sample t test can be applied to outcome scores or to differences between the baseline and outcome scores. Robustness of these t tests, in the presence of distributions "distorted" from normality as described, was investigated by computer simulation. In general, both t tests produced actual significance levels which were close to nominal significance levels, even in the presence of small samples and distributions in which as many as 50\% of the subjects attained scores of zero.},

Areas of application include: the comparison of samples; the comparison of distributions; the presentation of results on sensitivities of statistical methods; the analysis of collections of contrasts and of collections of sample variances; the assessment of multivariate contrasts; and the structuring of analysis of variances; mean squares. Many of the objectives and techniques are illustrated by examples.},
