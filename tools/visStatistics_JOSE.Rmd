# Summary
The R [@Rcoreteam:2025] package `visStatistics` [@Schilling:2025] automates the selection and execution of statistical hypothesis tests based on the class, distribution, and sample size of two input vectors. The package presents results using annotated, publication-ready visualizations matched to the selected method, with relevant test statistics, assumption checks, and post-hoc comparisons where applicable.

# Statement of Need
Typical undergraduate introductory statistics courses introduce a core set of hypothesis tests; however, selecting the appropriate method requires users to evaluate variable types, sample sizes, and distributional assumptions. This complexity often leads users to make incorrect test choices or to skip statistical testing entirely when uncertain.

While numerous R packages provide statistical testing functionality, few are designed with pedagogical accessibility as a primary concern. The `visStatistics` package addresses this challenge by automating test selection based on deterministic decision logic, removing the burden of manual test selection. This automation enables users to directly engage with the interpretation of statistical outcomes rather than being bogged down in test selection mechanics. The tailored visual outputs, annotated with test results and assumption checks, further aid comprehension and ensure that valid statistical conclusions are drawn from the outset.

The package is particularly valuable in statistical consulting for student research projects, where time constraints make streamlined, assumption-aware output essential for focusing on interpretation rather than technical execution.
