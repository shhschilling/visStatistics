# Introduction

Statistical hypothesis testing is fundamental to data analysis but often
suffers from inconsistencies and inefficiencies, particularly in
server-based deployments and time-constrained settings like statistical
consulting. In such contexts, users have limited interaction capabilities and
require methods that are both reliable and streamlined.

The `visStatistics` R package addresses this challenge with an automated and
reproducible decision logic pipeline. Given two vectors and a user-defined
confidence level, the function selects an appropriate test based on the type
of data and its distribution, returning visual summaries annotated with the
results. This eliminates manual selection errors and reduces analysis time.

The package is particularly valuable for consulting workflows, automated
reporting systems, and student research projects. It also serves a pedagogical
function: statistical beginners are relieved from memorising test conditions,
as the tool guarantees a valid method is used, along with clear visual output.

# Decision logic

Throughout the remainder, data of class `"numeric"` or `"integer"` are referred 
to by their common `mode` `numeric`, while data of class `"factor"` are referred to as categorical.
The significance level $lpha$, used throughout for hypothesis testing, is defined as `1 - conf.level`, where `conf.level` is a user-controllable argument (defaulting to `0.95`).

The choice of statistical tests performed by the function `visstat()` depends on whether the data are numeric or categorical, the number of levels in the categorical variable, the distribution of the data, as well as the user-defined 'conf.level'.

The function prioritizes interpretable visual output and tests that remain valid under the following decision logic:

- If both `x` and `y` are numeric, a simple linear regression model is fitted and analysed, including residual diagnostics and confidence bands.

- If `x` is categorical and `y` is numeric:
  - If `x` has exactly two levels, the distribution of the numeric variable is tested for normality using `shapiro.test()`. If normality is rejected, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (`wilcox.test()`) is applied; otherwise, Welch's t-test (`t.test()`).
  - If `x` has more than two levels, a one-way ANOVA (`aov()`) is initially fitted and tested for normality (Shapiro–Wilk test on residuals) and homoscedasticity (Bartlett test). Depending on the outcome, either Fisher's ANOVA, Welch's ANOVA (`oneway.test()`), or Kruskal–Wallis test (`kruskal.test()`) is applied. Post-hoc tests are added if required.

- If both `x` and `y` are categorical, Pearson's Chi-squared test is applied if all expected cell counts are ≥ 5. Otherwise, Fisher's exact test (`fisher.test()`) is used.

# Using visstat()

```r
visstat(x, y)

visstat(dataframe, "name_of_y", "name_of_x")

visstat(dataframe[["name_of_x"]], dataframe[["name_of_y"]])
```

# Examples

#### Welch's t-test {.unnumbered}

```r
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
visstat(mtcars$am, mtcars$mpg)

visstat(mtcars$am, mtcars$mpg, conf.level = 0.99)
```

#### Wilcoxon rank sum test {.unnumbered}

```r
grades_gender <- data.frame(
  sex = as.factor(c(rep("girl", 21), rep("boy", 23))),
  grade = c(
    19.3, 18.1, 15.2, 18.3, 7.9, 6.2, 19.4,
    20.3, 9.3, 11.3, 18.2, 17.5, 10.2, 20.1, 13.3, 17.2, 15.1, 16.2, 17.0,
    16.5, 5.1, 15.3, 17.1, 14.8, 15.4, 14.4, 7.5, 15.5, 6.0, 17.4,
    7.3, 14.3, 13.5, 8.0, 19.5, 13.4, 17.9, 17.7, 16.4, 15.6, 17.3, 19.9, 4.4, 2.1
  )
)

visstat(grades_gender$sex, grades_gender$grade)
```

# Benchmark against existing packages

A key differentiator among these packages is the intended target audience.
`visStatistics` is tailored to users seeking a transparent introduction to
statistical testing, particularly those following a standard undergraduate
curriculum. It automates the correct application of the full range of tests typically taught in an undergraduate-level inferential statistics course,
ensures reproducibility, and explains each decision via visual output.

Several R packages implement automated statistical test selection with
transparent decision logic. The table below compares `visStatistics` with
three such tools: `finalfit`, `automatedtests`, and `STATom@ic`.

| Feature                                        | visStatistics | automatedtests | STATom@ic | finalfit |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Automated test selection with transparent logic| ✓             | ✓              | ✓         | ✓        |
| Visual output of test decisions and results    | ✓             | ✗              | ✗         | ✗        |
| Regression modeling support                    | ✗             | ✓              | ✓         | ✓        |
| Omics data support                             | ✗             | ✗              | ✓         | ✗        |

- `visStatistics` focuses on visualising statistical test results with clear,
  annotated output and supports decision logic for a broad range of test types.
- `automatedtests` automates test selection with clear tabular results, but no
  plots or post-hoc visuals.
- `STATom@ic` targets omics datasets and includes assumption checks and
  automated selection but is specialised.
- `finalfit` offers test summaries and regression models but lacks support for
  pairwise test logic or visual diagnostics.

# Conclusion and outlook

`visStatistics` addresses a gap in exploratory statistical analysis in R: the
transparent selection and presentation of hypothesis tests between variable
pairs. It is designed for both teaching and practice, allowing analysts to
quickly assess relationships with appropriate statistical justification.
