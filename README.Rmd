# visStatistics

Visualization of the statistical hypothesis test between two groups of categorical or numerical data.

Statistical consulting  requires often both a quick first visualization and a reproducible statistical analysis 
of the presented raw data. The package `visStatistics` with its core function `visstat()` fulfils this need. 
Based on a decision tree it picks the statistical hypothesis test  with the highest statistical power between the dependent variable (response) `varsample` and the independent variable (feature) `varfactor`. 
The corresponding test statistics including eventual post-hoc-analysis are returned and 
a graph showing key statistics of the underlying test is generated. 

This fully automated workflow is especially suited for browser based interfaces to server-based
deployments of R and has been successfully implemented to analyse medical raw data in an unbiased fashion.
 
A detailed description of the package's functionality and its underlying decision tree, can be found in the `vignette` accompanying this package.

## Implemented tests
`lm()`, `t.test()`, `wilcox.test()`, `aov()`, `kruskal.test()`, `fisher.test()`, `chisqu.test()`

### Implemented tests to check the normal distribution of standardized residuals
`shapiro.test()` and `ad.test()`

### Implemented post-hoc tests
`TukeyHSD()` for `aov() `and `pairwise.wilcox.test()` for `kruskal.test()`

## Getting Started
The package vignette
allows you to get familiar with all features of `visStatistics`. It documents in detail the algorithm of the decision tree illustrated by examples. 

## Examples 

```{r example}
library(visStatistics)
```
###  Welch Two Sample t.test

#### InsectSprays data set

```{r}
InsectSpraysAB <- InsectSprays[ which(InsectSprays$spray == 'A' | InsectSprays$spray == 'B'), ] 
InsectSpraysAB$spray = factor(InsectSpraysAB$spray)
visstat(InsectSpraysAB,"count","spray")
```

#### mtcars data set

```{r}

```

```{r}
mtcars$am = as.factor(mtcars$am)
ttestStatistics = visstat(mtcars,"mpg","am") 
```
Uncomment below line to print out summary statistics:
```{r}
#ttestStatistics
```

### Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

```{r}
visstat(ToothGrowth,"len", "supp")
```

### One-way test

```{r}
 anova_npk = visstat(npk,"yield","block")
```

### Kruskal-Wallis test
The generated graphs can be saved in all available formats of the `Cairo` package. 
Here we save the graphical output of type "pdf" in the `plotDirectory` `tempdir()`:
```{r}
visstat(iris,"Petal.Width","Species",graphicsoutput = "pdf",plotDirectory = tempdir())
```
### Linear Regression

```{r}
linreg_cars = visstat(cars,"dist","speed")
```
Increasing the confidence level `conf.level` from the default 0.95 to 0.99 leads two wider confidence and prediction bands:
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
linreg_cars = visstat(cars,"dist","speed",conf.level = 0.99)
```
### Pearson's Chi-squared test

Count data sets are often presented as multidimensional arrays, so called contingency tables, whereas `visstat()` requires a `data.frame` with a column structure. Arrays can be transformed to this column wise structure with the helper function `counts_to_cases()`:
```{r}
HairEyeColorDataFrame = counts_to_cases(as.data.frame(HairEyeColor))
visstat(HairEyeColorDataFrame,"Hair","Eye")
```

###  Fisher's exact test

```{r}
HairEyeColorMaleFisher = HairEyeColor[,,1]
#slicing out a 2 x2 contingency table
blackBrownHazelGreen = HairEyeColorMaleFisher[1:2,3:4]
blackBrownHazelGreen = counts_to_cases(as.data.frame(blackBrownHazelGreen));
fisher_stats = visstat(blackBrownHazelGreen,"Hair","Eye")
```
